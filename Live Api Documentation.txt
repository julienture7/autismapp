Send feedbackLive API



Preview: The Live API is in preview.
The Live API enables low-latency bidirectional voice and video interactions with Gemini, letting you talk to Gemini live while also streaming video input or sharing your screen. Using the Live API, you can provide end users with the experience of natural, human-like voice conversations.

You can try the Live API in Google AI Studio. To use the Live API in Google AI Studio, select Stream.

How the Live API works
Streaming
The Live API uses a streaming model over a WebSocket connection. When you interact with the API, a persistent connection is created. Your input (audio, video, or text) is streamed continuously to the model, and the model's response (text or audio) is streamed back in real-time over the same connection.

This bidirectional streaming ensures low latency and supports features such as voice activity detection, tool usage, and speech generation.

Live API Overview

For more information about the underlying WebSockets API, see the WebSockets API reference.

Warning: It is unsafe to insert your API key into client-side JavaScript or TypeScript code. Use server-side deployments for accessing the Live API in production.
Output generation
The Live API processes multimodal input (text, audio, video) to generate text or audio in real-time. It comes with a built-in mechanism to generate audio and depending on the model version you use, it uses one of the two audio generation methods:

Half cascade: The model receives native audio input and uses a specialized model cascade of distinct models to process the input and to generate audio output.
Native: Gemini 2.5 introduces native audio generation, which directly generates audio output, providing a more natural sounding audio, more expressive voices, more awareness of additional context, e.g., tone, and more proactive responses.
Building with Live API
Before you begin building with the Live API, choose the audio generation approach that best fits your needs.

Establishing a connection
The following example shows how to create a connection with an API key:

Python
JavaScript

import asyncio
from google import genai

client = genai.Client(api_key="GEMINI_API_KEY")

model = "gemini-2.0-flash-live-001"
config = {"response_modalities": ["TEXT"]}

async def main():
    async with client.aio.live.connect(model=model, config=config) as session:
        print("Session started")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Note: You can only set one modality in the response_modalities field. This means that you can configure the model to respond with either text or audio, but not both in the same session.
Sending and receiving text
Here's how you can send and receive text:

Python
JavaScript

import asyncio
from google import genai

client = genai.Client(api_key="GEMINI_API_KEY")
model = "gemini-2.0-flash-live-001"

config = {"response_modalities": ["TEXT"]}

async def main():
    async with client.aio.live.connect(model=model, config=config) as session:
        message = "Hello, how are you?"
        await session.send_client_content(
            turns={"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": message}]}, turn_complete=True
        )

        async for response in session.receive():
            if response.text is not None:
                print(response.text, end="")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Sending and receiving audio
You can send audio by converting it to 16-bit PCM, 16kHz, mono format. This example reads a WAV file and sends it in the correct format:

Python
JavaScript
# Test file: https://storage.googleapis.com/generativeai-downloads/data/16000.wav
# Install helpers for converting files: pip install librosa soundfile
import asyncio
import io
from pathlib import Path
from google import genai
from google.genai import types
import soundfile as sf
import librosa

client = genai.Client(api_key="GEMINI_API_KEY")
model = "gemini-2.0-flash-live-001"

config = {"response_modalities": ["TEXT"]}

async def main():
    async with client.aio.live.connect(model=model, config=config) as session:

        buffer = io.BytesIO()
        y, sr = librosa.load("sample.wav", sr=16000)
        sf.write(buffer, y, sr, format='RAW', subtype='PCM_16')
        buffer.seek(0)
        audio_bytes = buffer.read()

        # If already in correct format, you can use this:
        # audio_bytes = Path("sample.pcm").read_bytes()

        await session.send_realtime_input(
            audio=types.Blob(data=audio_bytes, mime_type="audio/pcm;rate=16000")
        )

        async for response in session.receive():
            if response.text is not None:
                print(response.text)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
You can receive audio by setting AUDIO as response modality. This example saves the received data as WAV file:

Python
JavaScript

import asyncio
import wave
from google import genai

client = genai.Client(api_key="GEMINI_API_KEY")
model = "gemini-2.0-flash-live-001"

config = {"response_modalities": ["AUDIO"]}

async def main():
    async with client.aio.live.connect(model=model, config=config) as session:
        wf = wave.open("audio.wav", "wb")
        wf.setnchannels(1)
        wf.setsampwidth(2)
        wf.setframerate(24000)

        message = "Hello how are you?"
        await session.send_client_content(
            turns={"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": message}]}, turn_complete=True
        )

        async for idx,response in async_enumerate(session.receive()):
            if response.data is not None:
                wf.writeframes(response.data)

            # Un-comment this code to print audio data info
            # if response.server_content.model_turn is not None:
            #      print(response.server_content.model_turn.parts[0].inline_data.mime_type)

        wf.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Audio formats
Audio data in the Live API is always raw, little-endian, 16-bit PCM. Audio output always uses a sample rate of 24kHz. Input audio is natively 16kHz, but the Live API will resample if needed so any sample rate can be sent. To convey the sample rate of input audio, set the MIME type of each audio-containing Blob to a value like audio/pcm;rate=16000.

Receiving audio transcriptions
You can enable transcription of the model's audio output by sending output_audio_transcription in the setup config. The transcription language is inferred from the model's response.


import asyncio
from google import genai
from google.genai import types

client = genai.Client(api_key="GEMINI_API_KEY")
model = "gemini-2.0-flash-live-001"

config = {"response_modalities": ["AUDIO"],
          "output_audio_transcription": {}
}

async def main():
    async with client.aio.live.connect(model=model, config=config) as session:
        message = "Hello? Gemini are you there?"

        await session.send_client_content(
            turns={"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": message}]}, turn_complete=True
        )

        async for response in session.receive():
            if response.server_content.model_turn:
                print("Model turn:", response.server_content.model_turn)
            if response.server_content.output_transcription:
                print("Transcript:", response.server_content.output_transcription.text)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
You can enable transcription of the audio input by sending input_audio_transcription in setup config.

import asyncio
from google import genai
from google.genai import types

client = genai.Client(api_key="GEMINI_API_KEY")
model = "gemini-2.0-flash-live-001"

config = {"response_modalities": ["TEXT"],
    "realtime_input_config": {
        "automatic_activity_detection": {"disabled": True},
        "activity_handling": "NO_INTERRUPTION",
    },
    "input_audio_transcription": {},
}

async def main():
    async with client.aio.live.connect(model=model, config=config) as session:
        audio_data = Path("sample.pcm").read_bytes()

        await session.send_realtime_input(activity_start=types.ActivityStart())
        await session.send_realtime_input(
            audio=types.Blob(data=audio_data, mime_type='audio/pcm;rate=16000')
        )
        await session.send_realtime_input(activity_end=types.ActivityEnd())

        async for msg in session.receive():
            if msg.server_content.input_transcription:
                print('Transcript:', msg.server_content.input_transcription.text)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Streaming audio and video
To see an example of how to use the Live API in a streaming audio and video format, run the "Live API - Get Started" file in the cookbooks repository:

View on GitHub

System instructions
System instructions let you steer the behavior of a model based on your specific needs and use cases. System instructions can be set in the setup configuration and will remain in effect for the entire session.

from google.genai import types

config = {
    "system_instruction": types.Content(
        parts=[
            types.Part(
                text="You are a helpful assistant and answer in a friendly tone."
            )
        ]
    ),
    "response_modalities": ["TEXT"],
}
Incremental content updates
Use incremental updates to send text input, establish session context, or restore session context. For short contexts you can send turn-by-turn interactions to represent the exact sequence of events:

Python
JSON
turns = [
    {"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "What is the capital of France?"}]},
    {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Paris"}]},
]

await session.send_client_content(turns=turns, turn_complete=False)

turns = [{"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "What is the capital of Germany?"}]}]

await session.send_client_content(turns=turns, turn_complete=True)
For longer contexts it's recommended to provide a single message summary to free up the context window for subsequent interactions.

Changing voice and language
The Live API supports the following voices: Puck, Charon, Kore, Fenrir, Aoede, Leda, Orus, and Zephyr.

To specify a voice, set the voice name within the speechConfig object as part of the session configuration:

Python
JSON
from google.genai import types

config = types.LiveConnectConfig(
    response_modalities=["AUDIO"],
    speech_config=types.SpeechConfig(
        voice_config=types.VoiceConfig(
            prebuilt_voice_config=types.PrebuiltVoiceConfig(voice_name="Kore")
        )
    )
)
Note: If you're using the generateContent API, the set of available voices is slightly different. See the audio generation guide for generateContent audio generation voices.
The Live API supports multiple languages.

To change the language, set the language code within the speechConfig object as part of the session configuration:

from google.genai import types

config = types.LiveConnectConfig(
    response_modalities=["AUDIO"],
    speech_config=types.SpeechConfig(
        language_code="de-DE",
    )
)
Note: Native audio output models automatically choose the appropriate language and don't support explicitly setting the language code.
Native audio output
Through the Live API, you can also access models that allow for native audio output in addition to native audio input. This allows for higher quality audio outputs with better pacing, voice naturalness, verbosity, and mood.

Native audio output is supported by the following native audio models:

gemini-2.5-flash-preview-native-audio-dialog
gemini-2.5-flash-exp-native-audio-thinking-dialog
Note: Native audio models currently have limited tool use support. See Overview of supported tools for details.
How to use native audio output
To use native audio output, configure one of the native audio models and set response_modalities to AUDIO:

model = "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-native-audio-dialog"
config = types.LiveConnectConfig(response_modalities=["AUDIO"])

async with client.aio.live.connect(model=model, config=config) as session:
    # Send audio input and receive audio
Affective dialog
This feature lets Gemini adapt its response style to the input expression and tone.

To use affective dialog, set enable_affective_dialog to truein the setup message:

config = types.LiveConnectConfig(
    response_modalities=["AUDIO"],
    enable_affective_dialog=True
)
Note that affective dialog is currently only supported by the native audio output models.

Proactive audio
When this feature is enabled, Gemini can proactively decide not to respond if the content is not relevant.

To use it, configure the proactivity field in the setup message and set proactive_audio to true:


config = types.LiveConnectConfig(
    response_modalities=["AUDIO"],
    proactivity={'proactive_audio': True}
)
Note that proactive audio is currently only supported by the native audio output models.

Native audio output with thinking
Native audio output supports thinking capabilities, available via a separate model gemini-2.5-flash-exp-native-audio-thinking-dialog.


model = "gemini-2.5-flash-exp-native-audio-thinking-dialog"
config = types.LiveConnectConfig(response_modalities=["AUDIO"])

async with client.aio.live.connect(model=model, config=config) as session:
    # Send audio input and receive audio
Tool use with Live API
You can define tools such as Function calling, Code execution, and Google Search with the Live API.

To see examples of all tools in the Live API, run the "Live API Tools" cookbook:

View on GitHub

Overview of supported tools
Here's a brief overview of the available tools for each model:

Tool	Cascaded models
gemini-2.0-flash-live-001	gemini-2.5-flash-preview-native-audio-dialog	gemini-2.5-flash-exp-native-audio-thinking-dialog
Search	Yes	Yes	Yes
Function calling	Yes	Yes	No
Code execution	Yes	No	No
Url context	Yes	No	No
Function calling
You can define function declarations as part of the session configuration. See the Function calling tutorial to learn more.

After receiving tool calls, the client should respond with a list of FunctionResponse objects using the session.send_tool_response method.

Note: Unlike the generateContent API, the Live API doesn't support automatic tool response handling. You must handle tool responses manually in your client code.

import asyncio
from google import genai
from google.genai import types

client = genai.Client(api_key="GEMINI_API_KEY")
model = "gemini-2.0-flash-live-001"

# Simple function definitions
turn_on_the_lights = {"name": "turn_on_the_lights"}
turn_off_the_lights = {"name": "turn_off_the_lights"}

tools = [{"function_declarations": [turn_on_the_lights, turn_off_the_lights]}]
config = {"response_modalities": ["TEXT"], "tools": tools}

async def main():
    async with client.aio.live.connect(model=model, config=config) as session:
        prompt = "Turn on the lights please"
        await session.send_client_content(turns={"parts": [{"text": prompt}]})

        async for chunk in session.receive():
            if chunk.server_content:
                if chunk.text is not None:
                    print(chunk.text)
            elif chunk.tool_call:
                function_responses = []
                for fc in tool_call.function_calls:
                    function_response = types.FunctionResponse(
                        id=fc.id,
                        name=fc.name,
                        response={ "result": "ok" } # simple, hard-coded function response
                    )
                    function_responses.append(function_response)

                await session.send_tool_response(function_responses=function_responses)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
From a single prompt, the model can generate multiple function calls and the code necessary to chain their outputs. This code executes in a sandbox environment, generating subsequent BidiGenerateContentToolCall messages.

Asynchronous function calling
By default, the execution pauses until the results of each function call are available, which ensures sequential processing. It means you won't be able to continue interacting with the model while the functions are being run.

If you don't want to block the conversation, you can tell the model to run the functions asynchronously.

To do so, you first need to add a behavior to the function definitions:


  # Non-blocking function definitions
  turn_on_the_lights = {"name": "turn_on_the_lights", "behavior": "NON_BLOCKING"} # turn_on_the_lights will run asynchronously
  turn_off_the_lights = {"name": "turn_off_the_lights"} # turn_off_the_lights will still pause all interactions with the model
NON-BLOCKING will ensure the function will run asynchronously while you can continue interacting with the model.

Then you need to tell the model how to behave when it receives the FunctionResponse using the scheduling parameter. It can either:

Interrupt what it's doing and tell you about the response it got right away (scheduling="INTERRUPT"),
Wait until it's finished with what it's currently doing (scheduling="WHEN_IDLE"),
Or do nothing and use that knowledge later on in the discussion (scheduling="SILENT")

# Non-blocking function definitions
  function_response = types.FunctionResponse(
      id=fc.id,
      name=fc.name,
      response={
          "result": "ok",
          "scheduling": "INTERRUPT" # Can also be WHEN_IDLE or SILENT
      }
  )
Code execution
You can define code execution as part of the session configuration. See the Code execution tutorial to learn more.


import asyncio
from google import genai
from google.genai import types

client = genai.Client(api_key="GEMINI_API_KEY")
model = "gemini-2.0-flash-live-001"

tools = [{'code_execution': {}}]
config = {"response_modalities": ["TEXT"], "tools": tools}

async def main():
    async with client.aio.live.connect(model=model, config=config) as session:
        prompt = "Compute the largest prime palindrome under 100000."
        await session.send_client_content(turns={"parts": [{"text": prompt}]})

        async for chunk in session.receive():
            if chunk.server_content:
                if chunk.text is not None:
                    print(chunk.text)
            
                model_turn = chunk.server_content.model_turn
                if model_turn:
                    for part in model_turn.parts:
                      if part.executable_code is not None:
                        print(part.executable_code.code)

                      if part.code_execution_result is not None:
                        print(part.code_execution_result.output)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Grounding with Google Search
You can enable Grounding with Google Search as part of the session configuration. See the Grounding tutorial to learn more.


import asyncio
from google import genai
from google.genai import types

client = genai.Client(api_key="GEMINI_API_KEY")
model = "gemini-2.0-flash-live-001"

tools = [{'google_search': {}}]
config = {"response_modalities": ["TEXT"], "tools": tools}

async def main():
    async with client.aio.live.connect(model=model, config=config) as session:
        prompt = "When did the last Brazil vs. Argentina soccer match happen?"
        await session.send_client_content(turns={"parts": [{"text": prompt}]})

        async for chunk in session.receive():
            if chunk.server_content:
                if chunk.text is not None:
                    print(chunk.text)

                # The model might generate and execute Python code to use Search
                model_turn = chunk.server_content.model_turn
                if model_turn:
                    for part in model_turn.parts:
                      if part.executable_code is not None:
                        print(part.executable_code.code)

                      if part.code_execution_result is not None:
                        print(part.code_execution_result.output)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Combining multiple tools
You can combine multiple tools within the Live API:

prompt = """
Hey, I need you to do three things for me.

1. Compute the largest prime palindrome under 100000.
2. Then use Google Search to look up information about the largest earthquake in California the week of Dec 5 2024?
3. Turn on the lights

Thanks!
"""

tools = [
    {"google_search": {}},
    {"code_execution": {}},
    {"function_declarations": [turn_on_the_lights, turn_off_the_lights]},
]

config = {"response_modalities": ["TEXT"], "tools": tools}
Handling interruptions
Users can interrupt the model's output at any time. When Voice activity detection (VAD) detects an interruption, the ongoing generation is canceled and discarded. Only the information already sent to the client is retained in the session history. The server then sends a BidiGenerateContentServerContent message to report the interruption.

In addition, the Gemini server discards any pending function calls and sends a BidiGenerateContentServerContent message with the IDs of the canceled calls.

async for response in session.receive():
    if response.server_content.interrupted is True:
        # The generation was interrupted
Voice activity detection (VAD)
You can configure or disable voice activity detection (VAD).

Using automatic VAD
By default, the model automatically performs VAD on a continuous audio input stream. VAD can be configured with the realtimeInputConfig.automaticActivityDetection field of the setup configuration.

When the audio stream is paused for more than a second (for example, because the user switched off the microphone), an audioStreamEnd event should be sent to flush any cached audio. The client can resume sending audio data at any time.

# example audio file to try:
# URL = "https://storage.googleapis.com/generativeai-downloads/data/hello_are_you_there.pcm"
# !wget -q $URL -O sample.pcm
import asyncio
from pathlib import Path
from google import genai
from google.genai import types

client = genai.Client(api_key="GEMINI_API_KEY")
model = "gemini-2.0-flash-live-001"

config = {"response_modalities": ["TEXT"]}

async def main():
    async with client.aio.live.connect(model=model, config=config) as session:
        audio_bytes = Path("sample.pcm").read_bytes()

        await session.send_realtime_input(
            audio=types.Blob(data=audio_bytes, mime_type="audio/pcm;rate=16000")
        )

        # if stream gets paused, send:
        # await session.send_realtime_input(audio_stream_end=True)

        async for response in session.receive():
            if response.text is not None:
                print(response.text)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
With send_realtime_input, the API will respond to audio automatically based on VAD. While send_client_content adds messages to the model context in order, send_realtime_input is optimized for responsiveness at the expense of deterministic ordering.

Configuring automatic VAD
For more control over the VAD activity, you can configure the following parameters. See API reference for more info.

from google.genai import types

config = {
    "response_modalities": ["TEXT"],
    "realtime_input_config": {
        "automatic_activity_detection": {
            "disabled": False, # default
            "start_of_speech_sensitivity": types.StartSensitivity.START_SENSITIVITY_LOW,
            "end_of_speech_sensitivity": types.EndSensitivity.END_SENSITIVITY_LOW,
            "prefix_padding_ms": 20,
            "silence_duration_ms": 100,
        }
    }
}
Disabling automatic VAD
Alternatively, the automatic VAD can be disabled by setting realtimeInputConfig.automaticActivityDetection.disabled to true in the setup message. In this configuration the client is responsible for detecting user speech and sending activityStart and activityEnd messages at the appropriate times. An audioStreamEnd isn't sent in this configuration. Instead, any interruption of the stream is marked by an activityEnd message.

config = {
    "response_modalities": ["TEXT"],
    "realtime_input_config": {"automatic_activity_detection": {"disabled": True}},
}

async with client.aio.live.connect(model=model, config=config) as session:
    # ...
    await session.send_realtime_input(activity_start=types.ActivityStart())
    await session.send_realtime_input(
        audio=types.Blob(data=audio_bytes, mime_type="audio/pcm;rate=16000")
    )
    await session.send_realtime_input(activity_end=types.ActivityEnd())
    # ...
Token count
You can find the total number of consumed tokens in the usageMetadata field of the returned server message.

async for message in session.receive():
    # The server will periodically send messages that include UsageMetadata.

                case types.ModalityTokenCount(modality=modality, token_count=count):
                    print(f"{modality}: {count}")
Extending the session duration
The maximum session duration can be extended to unlimited with two mechanisms:

Context window compression
Session resumption
Furthermore, you'll receive a GoAway message before the session ends, allowing you to take further actions.

Context window compression
To enable longer sessions, and avoid abrupt connection termination, you can enable context window compression by setting the contextWindowCompression field as part of the session configuration.

In the ContextWindowCompressionConfig, you can configure a sliding-window mechanism and the number of tokens that triggers compression.

from google.genai import types

config = types.LiveConnectConfig(
    response_modalities=["AUDIO"],
    context_window_compression=(
        # Configures compression with default parameters.
        types.ContextWindowCompressionConfig(
            sliding_window=types.SlidingWindow(),
        )
    ),
)
Session resumption
To prevent session termination when the server periodically resets the WebSocket connection, configure the sessionResumption field within the setup configuration.

Passing this configuration causes the server to send SessionResumptionUpdate messages, which can be used to resume the session by passing the last resumption token as the SessionResumptionConfig.handle of the subsequent connection.

import asyncio
from google import genai
from google.genai import types

client = genai.Client(api_key="GEMINI_API_KEY")
model = "gemini-2.0-flash-live-001"

async def main():
    print(f"Connecting to the service with handle {previous_session_handle}...")
    async with client.aio.live.connect(
        model=model,
        config=types.LiveConnectConfig(
            response_modalities=["AUDIO"],
            session_resumption=types.SessionResumptionConfig(
                # The handle of the session to resume is passed here,
                # or else None to start a new session.
                handle=previous_session_handle
            ),
        ),
    ) as session:
        while True:
            await session.send_client_content(
                turns=types.Content(
                    role="user", parts=[types.Part(text="Hello world!")]
                )
            )
            async for message in session.receive():
                # Periodically, the server will send update messages that may
                # contain a handle for the current state of the session.
                if message.session_resumption_update:
                    update = message.session_resumption_update
                    if update.resumable and update.new_handle:
                        # The handle should be retained and linked to the session.
                        return update.new_handle

                # For the purposes of this example, placeholder input is continually fed
                # to the model. In non-sample code, the model inputs would come from
                # the user.
                if message.server_content and message.server_content.turn_complete:
                    break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Receiving a message before the session disconnects
The server sends a GoAway message that signals that the current connection will soon be terminated. This message includes the timeLeft, indicating the remaining time and lets you take further action before the connection will be terminated as ABORTED.

async for response in session.receive():
    if response.go_away is not None:
        # The connection will soon be terminated
        print(response.go_away.time_left)
Receiving a message when the generation is complete
The server sends a generationComplete message that signals that the model finished generating the response.

async for response in session.receive():
    if response.server_content.generation_complete is True:
        # The generation is complete
Media resolution
You can specify the media resolution for the input media by setting the mediaResolution field as part of the session configuration:

from google.genai import types

config = types.LiveConnectConfig(
    response_modalities=["AUDIO"],
    media_resolution=types.MediaResolution.MEDIA_RESOLUTION_LOW,
)
Limitations
Consider the following limitations of the Live API when you plan your project.

Response modalities
You can only set one response modality (TEXT or AUDIO) per session in the session configuration. Setting both results in a config error message. This means that you can configure the model to respond with either text or audio, but not both in the same session.

Client authentication
The Live API only provides server to server authentication and isn't recommended for direct client use. Client input should be routed through an intermediate application server for secure authentication with the Live API.

Session duration
Session duration can be extended to unlimited by enabling session compression. Without compression, audio-only sessions are limited to 15 minutes, and audio plus video sessions are limited to 2 minutes. Exceeding these limits without compression will terminate the connection.

Additionally, you can configure session resumption to allow the client to resume a session that was terminated.

Context window
A session has a context window limit of:

128k tokens for native audio output models
32k tokens for other Live API models
Supported languages
Live API supports the following languages.

Note: Native audio output models automatically choose the appropriate language and don't support explicitly setting the language code.
